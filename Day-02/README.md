# 🚀 Day 2 - System Design & Integration: Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025

Welcome to Day 2 of my Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 journey! 🎉 Today, I focused on designing the system architecture and defining how the frontend connects with the backend, along with integration details for third-party APIs.

## 🛠️ System Design Overview

The system is designed to provide a seamless and scalable platform, ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend and backend for an intuitive shopping experience. Here's an overview:

### 🎯 Frontend-Backend Integration

**Frontend Framework:**
- **Next.js**: Framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a UI components library like ShadCN UI.
- **State Management:** Zustand for state handling.

**Backend:**
- **Sanity.io**: CMS for content management and API routes, serving data to the frontend through RESTful APIs.

**Communication:**
- Frontend interacts with Sanity and other APIs through HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### 🌐 Third-Party API Integration

**Third-Party API Purpose:**
- Handle features like payment processing and product availability.

**Integration Flow:**
1. The frontend sends requests to the backend.
2. The backend processes the data and interacts with the third-party API.
3. The backend retrieves the required information and sends it to the frontend.

**Security Measures:**
- Secure communication using HTTPS.
- API key-based authentication for third-party services.

### 📊 API Routes Definition

Below is a list of planned API routes with their respective actions:

| Route                | Method | Action                                                                      |
|----------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/api/products`      | GET    | Fetches a list of all available products.                                   |
| `/api/order`         | POST   | Creates a new order and sends it to the third-party payment gateway.       |
| `/api/order/:id`     | GET    | Fetches details of a specific order using its ID.                          |
| `/api/order/:id`     | PUT    | Updates the status of the order (e.g., shipped, delivered).                |
| `/api/payment/verify`| GET    | Verifies payment status through the third-party API.                       |

## 💡 Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand

**Backend:**
- Sanity.io

**API Integration:**
- Third-party API for payment processing and product availability.

**Authentication:**
- Clerk authentication for secure login and transactions.

## 📃 Documenting the Flow

This flow outlines how data moves between components:
1. Frontend sends requests to the backend via API routes.
2. Backend processes these requests, interacts with third-party APIs, and sends responses back.
3. Frontend updates the UI based on the received data.

## 📝 Next Steps

- Implement API routes.
- Integrate third-party services.
- Begin frontend development to connect all components.

## 🚀 Day 2 Summary

The foundation for the system’s functionality, communication flow, and third-party API integration is set. The next steps involve translating this design into a fully operational marketplace.
